Thermostat Challenge
---------------------

## Introduction

This project was completed over week 5 of the Makers Academy software engineering bootcamp. In this project I have used Javascript to create a thermostat application which can:

* set the temperature
* toggle power saving mode on and off
* indicate energy usage by a change in text color
* provide current city temperatures by using AJAX to retrieve data from an API

All functionality for the web app is complete. Styling will have to come later...

## Getting Started

* Run `git clone git@github.com:marbuthnott/thermostat_challenge.git` from the terminal.
* Run `open thermostat.html` to start the application in a web browser.
